## Predicting Titanic survival using Random Forest

We need to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). To be able to predict which passengers were more likely to survive we will use Random Forest to train the model.

- Step 1: Import dataset

- Step 2: EDA & Clean Data

- Step 3: Build a first predictive model using Random Forest. Chose an evaluation metric and then optimize your model hyperparameters.

- Step 4: Save final model
